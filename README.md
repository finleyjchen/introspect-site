# introspect-site

This is a project for GRC 377 (Graphic Communications) at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo.

Introspect Studio’s is a fictitious branding, web design, digital marketing and development agency. It is meant to be what I would like my personal freelance business, Finley Chen Web Development, to become. The agency’s services would be tailored to my skills – eCommerce web development with a knack for minimalist design and good typography to allow the content (images and type) to shine.

Images are screenshots of sample websites that the company would probably be making.

### Technologies Used
